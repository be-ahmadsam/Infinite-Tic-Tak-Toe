# Tic-Tac-Toe 2.0

Tic-Tac-Toe 2.0 is an enhanced version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with dynamic gameplay features.

## Description

In Tic-Tac-Toe 2.0, players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, typically "X" and "O". The objective is to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. However, in this version, there's a unique rule:

**Infinite Tic-Tac-Toe:** Whenever a player marks their fourth "X" or "O", their initial mark disappears, keeping the game in constant motion until one player secures victory.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Marks disappear after the fourth placement, requiring strategic planning to secure victory.
- **Constant Motion:** The game remains active with marks disappearing, ensuring an engaging experience.
- **Reset Functionality:** Players can reset the game at any point, clearing the grid and starting anew.

## How to Play

1. Choose a symbol ("X" or "O") to represent you.
2. Click on any empty box in the grid to place your symbol.
3. Aim to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
4. Pay attention to the disappearing marks to plan your moves effectively.
5. Keep playing until one player secures victory or the game ends in a draw.
